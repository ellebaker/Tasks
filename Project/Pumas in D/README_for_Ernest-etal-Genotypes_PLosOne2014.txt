File contents:
Sample ID #
Population identifier
3-digit nuclear microsatellite genotypic data (diploid, one allele per column, two columns per locus) for 46 loci (42 for the focal populations of this paper).  Locus identifier is listed in the first of the two columns for data of each locus.
Data in one row per individual sample.

Note that analysis results may vary due to exact software version, iterations, and data input requirements.  For example, some programs may require different data formatting of certain loci or samples depending on type of data, etc.  Therefore others' results may differ from those the authors analyses showed.
